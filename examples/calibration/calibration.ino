Description:      1.The offset and crosstalk values are calibrated before leaving the factory
                  2.Calibration is generally not required unless the device is soldered on 
                  the customer board or a glass cover is added
                  3.The detected target is placed 140 mm away from the sensor
connection methodï¼š i2cPort:Wire  intPin:D2
